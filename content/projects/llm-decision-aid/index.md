Developing an equitable, scalable AI tool to support informed decision-making for cancer screening participants.

## The Challenge

Blood-based multi-cancer early detection (MCED) tests represent a paradigm shift in cancer screening. Unlike traditional single-cancer programmes, these tests screen for dozens of cancers simultaneously, creating unprecedented complexity for patient communication and informed consent.

## Our Approach

This research develops an **LLM-based decision support tool** designed with implementation at its core:

### Design Principles

1. **Equity-First Design** — Accessible language and interaction patterns across diverse populations
2. **Scalability for the Coming Wave** — Architecture designed for multiple test types
3. **Implementation Reality** — Resource-scarcity aware design, NHS pathway compatible
4. **Rigorous Evaluation Framework** — Contributing to evidence base for patient-facing AI evaluation

## Impact

This tool aims to ensure that as MCED tests become available, every person can make a genuinely informed decision about participation—regardless of background, education, or health literacy level.
