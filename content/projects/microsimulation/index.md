Modelling the potential population-level impact of blood-based cancer screening in the UK.

## The Question

If blood-based multi-cancer early detection (MCED) tests were implemented in the UK, what would be the population-level impact on cancer outcomes?

## Approach

This microsimulation modelling project tests potential scenarios for MCED implementation across the UK population, examining:

### Key Parameters

- **Uptake rates** — Informed by U-RESPOND qualitative findings
- **Test performance** — Sensitivity and specificity across cancer types
- **Stage shift** — Earlier detection and treatment timing
- **Healthcare capacity** — Diagnostic pathway requirements
- **Health economics** — Cost-effectiveness under various scenarios

### Model Outputs

1. **Cancers detected** — Number and stage distribution
2. **Lives saved** — Mortality impact estimates
3. **Resource requirements** — Follow-up tests, imaging, biopsies
4. **Equity impact** — Effects across socioeconomic groups

## Policy Relevance

As MCED tests approach regulatory approval, policymakers need robust evidence to inform implementation decisions. This modelling provides evidence base for NHS planning and economic arguments for adoption strategies.
