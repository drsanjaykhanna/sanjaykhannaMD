Comprehensive qualitative research using choice architecture to understand cancer screening responders and non-responders.

## Research Question

Why do some people respond to cancer screening invitations while others do not? And critically—how do both groups feel about the emerging generation of blood-based cancer screening tests?

## Study Design

**U-RESPOND** (Understanding Responses to Screening Programmes and New Detection) is a comprehensive qualitative research study conducted through the Royal Marsden Hospital's Early Detection and Diagnosis Unit.

### Methodology

- **Participants:** Historical cancer screening responders and non-responders
- **Approach:** In-depth qualitative interviews
- **Framework:** Choice architecture and behavioural science lens
- **Focus:** Attitudes toward blood-based multi-cancer early detection (MCED) tests

### Innovative Elements

This study applies **choice architecture principles** to understand screening behaviours:

1. **Default Effects** — How invitation framing influences response
2. **Friction Costs** — Barriers that prevent attendance
3. **Social Norms** — Community and family influences on decisions

## Significance

Understanding the psychological and social factors that drive screening decisions is essential for designing more effective screening programmes and reducing inequalities in uptake.
